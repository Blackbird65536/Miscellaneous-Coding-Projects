Yes, AI is miscellaneous, because I'm not planning to be a Machine Learning Person. (Although I still am trying it out.)
Here are a few of these concepts that I am trying out, as well as a few of my notes along the way. 
1. Gradient Descent
2. K-means, and many more if I don't procrastinate. 
3. Genetic Algorithm - We have something for it. Although there is much to be improved, I still want to keep it here.
