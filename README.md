Here is a file of miscellaneous coding projects that I have done. These do not fit into any particular category, neither cybsecurity, nor competitive programming, 
nor really any engineering projects in particular. Instead, these are more or less pieces of art to show off. I hope you enjoy this art gallery while you visit it.
