Here is a file of miscellaneous coding projects that I have done. These do not fit into any particular category, neither cybsecurity, nor competitive programming, 
nor really any engineering projects in particular. Instead, these are more or less pieces of art to show off. I hope you enjoy this art gallery while you visit it.

This is also closer to a blog, where I post some of my notes as to what I am doing. 

There's also some experimentation notes, as well as weekly (read: Yearly) updates as to some projects. 

Thanks,
